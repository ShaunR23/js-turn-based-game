You will be building a turn based battle game. If you're familiar with older video games, think of Pokemon or Final Fantasy. The UI can be basic, just some headings for names and info, a dropdown, and a couple of buttons. If you have no idea what any of this means, read through this and/or watch this.

The gameplay should go back and forth between an enemy and the player, each inflicting damage on the other when they launch a successful attack.
There should be multiple player types.
There should be multiple enemy types.
You should be able to select the player type from a dropdown.
The enemy type should be randomly generated.
The player should manually select the "Fight" action to attack.
The enemy should automatically attack when it is its turn.
You should use classes for the players and enemies.
The player's health should be visible.
The enemies health may be visible, at your discretion.
